Tripod is written in Python 3.5. The project consists of two Python files:

1. photoOrgMain.py
2. photoOrg_MainWindow.py

-----------------
Installation
-----------------

1. Copy the two files to the same directory of your choosing.
2. Install the following dependencies, if they are not already installed:
    a. Python 3.5 or greater (already installed in most Linux distros, like Ubuntu)
    b. Qt framework 5 or greater  (command line: sudo apt install python3-pyqt5)
    c. piexif python module (command line: pip3 install piexif)
    
To run Tripod, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the two Tripod files, and then enter "python3 photoOrgMain.py" (without the quotation marks).

General instructions
-------------------

Once the program is up and running, click the "Choose Files" button to select files from a directory that you want to rename or re-order. You can also edit their meta data. Tripod is not an image editor like GIMP.

Once the images load into the list, you can drag and drop them into the order you wish to preserve through their file names. You can use the Ctrl, Shift, End and Home keys with your mouse to select more than one image at a time.

Use the drop-down boxes and text boxes in the command box on the right of the screen to adjust the name, thumbnail, and metadata of the selected photos (or all of the photos, if you select that option.)
